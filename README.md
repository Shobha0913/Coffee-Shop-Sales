I created Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard using Power BI Desktop, powered by data sourced from MySQL. The purpose of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into a coffee chain’s sales performance for the month of May 2023. It highlights key metrics such as total sales ($157K), total orders (33.5K), and total quantity sold (48.2K). Using Power BI’s advanced visuals like calendar slicers, donut charts, bar charts, and heatmaps, I explored trends by product category, product type, store location, weekday vs weekend sales, and hourly performance. The data pipeline began with extraction from a MySQL database, followed by transformation using Power Query, and further analysis through DAX measures to calculate averages, totals, and peak periods. This dashboard not only reflects technical skill in data modeling and visualization but also emphasizes a human-centered approach to data—helping stakeholders understand when and what customers buy most, so decisions can be smarter and more customer-focused. This project demonstrates how to turn raw data into meaningful stories that drive business value.
